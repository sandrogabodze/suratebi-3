<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
     industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
      and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
       the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
        <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
         with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <strong>Lorem Ipsum.</strong></p>
         <br>
         <p><strong>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
        have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
         even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure 
         there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators 
         on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator 
         on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model 
         sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is
          therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</strong></p>
